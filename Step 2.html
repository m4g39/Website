        Now that we have an file that can read HTML, we should get to writing, First you want to add the "body" tag (tags are inbetween less than and greater than symbols), this seperates it from the head tag we added earlier. this body tag is mostly used for writing, which is our main focus. inside the body tag you can write just about anything and it will be visible, although it wont look very pretty. there are many different tags to do mostly what can be done on a google document, for examble <b> You can make things bold by the tag "b" </b>, which is a content tag which means it has an open and closing line. similarly we have the tag "i"<i> which is for italics which looks like This </i>, once again this is a content tag which means it has to incase the words you want to turn into italics and this also applies to underlining <u> which is "u" and looks like this</u>
    <br>
    <br> 
        you can also change the size of text using the tags "h1" and onward to change the size of the text, h stands for header and thats how i made the "welcome" to large. 
<br> <h1>H1</h1>
 <br> <h2>H2</h2>
 <br> <h3>h3</h3> <br>   ect, this is veyr usefull as to make it easier to read other than just a text block, which can be very unnapealing to the audience. 
    </p>

  HTML automatically fills in space, so you wont be able to create line breaks, unless you use specific tags, "br" or break is very known however i personally like using the "p" tag, which stands for paragraph , BR is a void tag which means it had no contents while p has contents inside of it, that is the main distinction between the two. 
        </p>
     <hr> 
     <p>
 but thats not it , you can add more such as the tag "hr" which creates a line on the screen as you can see above. 
        </p>
        </body>
