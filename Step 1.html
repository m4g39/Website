    Wow, and just like that we have a website, kind off, so how did we get here. well that is a very simnple step. firstly you need to make a new file on your desktop, or in any folder you want it to be in, you need to right click and then select "text document", then once youve made it rename it to whatver you like, however the most important part is to change the ".txt" to ".html", this means that it will open on your brouwser and function like a website instead of just a bunch of words on your computer. to edit this file further you need to download a file editor, such as brackets (what im using currently) or many others,

     now you have a place to code, but how do you add text?, well thats very simple, firsly on the first line of the file you should add "<!DOCTYPE html>, this is just so that your computer can understand what programing language you are coding in, if you dont do this very important step the rest will not work. furthermore just under that (the second line) you should add "html" within more than and less than symbols, and at the bottom of your code you should add /html within more than and less than symbols, this is so that you can further express what is and what isnt coded in html, however it is also an essential. now another not nessasary but recomended line is first put in "head" opening and closing (this means that it has two  different lines of code, being the opening which is simply less than ,"head", more than, and the closing one which is the same however there is a forward slashbefore the head. these types of code are called content code, this is because there is content within the lines.) "meta charset="utf-8" and the line under that is "meta name="viewport" content="width-device-width, initial-scale=1", both of them inside of greater than and less than symbols. what this does is the first line functions as a way to understand and let the computer read html, and the second line makes it so that if your website is viewed on a screen that has different length and width, it will still be able to be changed to whatever device is viewing it.

        that brings in the next problem, how do we get people to actually see this website, the next steps will help you with that,it might not have anything on it but it still works. the next file will show you how to add text, and also how to change the size of the text.
