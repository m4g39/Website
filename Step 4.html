    <h1> Step 4: Lists and bullet points </h1>
     </p>
    <br>
    <br> 
    Quite simply the list tag has two main deviations, the organized list and the unorganized list, the former being a numbered list and the latter being bullet points, the tags are "ol" for organized list and "ul" for unorganized list, both of these are <b>Content tags </b>. inside of those content tags you need to add a "li" which is also a <b>content tag </b>, everything inside of "li" will be a signle entry onto the list, for example 
    <ol>
        <li> summer </li>
        <li> fall</li>
        <li> winter</li>
        <li> spring</li>
</ol>
    <br>
    <br>

<br>
<br>
and now heres where things get more confusing, you can add a list inside of a list, for example, a list of game genres
    
    <ul>
    <li>Sports</li>
    <li>Videogames</li>
    <li>Boardgames</li>
    </ul>
 <br>
<br>
Pretty simple right? so lets make it a little more complex, and add the "li" inside of the "ul" tag inside of the "li" tag inside of the "ul" tag. as confusing as that sounds its very simple. we just take our list and add another list. 
    <ul>
    <li>Sports
        <ul> <li>Football</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li>Videogames
        <ul> 
        <li>Minecraft</li>
        <li>CS:GO</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li>Boardgames
        <ul>
        <li>Monopoly</li>
        <li>Chess</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    Although that does look like alot of work for a list, its ultimately very simple in nature, and once you get the hang of it its not that complicated, although it does get annoying when you forget to close one of the tags. 
    <br>
    <br>
this concludes the steps, theres alot more to explain like how to have a domain for the site, and how to add tables and organize the images better. however weve run out of time. hopefully this explained to you enough and got you interested in coding.
